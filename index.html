            As a junior front-end developer with two years of experience
            learning and practicing front-end development, as well as
            professional experience as a video editor in the IDF, I bring a
            unique set of skills to the table. I am passionate about front-end
            development and have been since the very beginning. Over the past
            two years, I have developed the skills necessary to build and
            maintain actual websites.

          <p>
            My experience as a video editor in the IDF has also helped me
            improve as a front-end developer. I am accustomed to working with
            very harsh deadlines, changing environments, and clients from all
            over the world, including army personnel, governments, and
            countries. I have experience working both alone and as a part of a
            team and have learned to adapt to different situations and
            requirements.

            across a large component tree, resulting in cleaner and more
            readable code, and faster performance.
